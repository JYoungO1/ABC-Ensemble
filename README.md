Enhancing Skin Lesion Classification Performance with the ABC Ensemble Model

Skin cancer is one of the most easily developed cancers and is continuously seeing an increased incidence rate. In this study, we propose a novel ABC ensemble model for skin lesion classification by leveraging the ABCD rule, which is commonly used in dermatology to evaluate lesion features such as asymmetry, border, color, and diameter. Our model consists of five distinct blocks, two of which focus on learning general image characteristics, while the remaining three focus on specialized features related to the ABCD rule. The final classification results are achieved through a weighted soft voting approach, where the generalization blocks are assigned higher weights to optimize performance. Through 15 experiments using various model configurations, we show that the weighted ABC ensemble model outperforms the baseline models, achieving the best performance with an accuracy of 0.9326 and an F1-score of 0.9302. Additionally, Grad-CAM analysis is employed to assess how each block in the ensemble focuses on distinct lesion features, further enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the model. Our findings demonstrate that integrating general image features with specific lesion characteristics improves classification performance, and that adjusting the soft voting weights yields optimal results. This novel model offers a reliable tool for early skin lesion diagnosis.
